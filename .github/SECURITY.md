## Reporting a Vulnerability

The CryptoTEE team takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Private Disclosure

**DO NOT** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead:

- Email us at: security@example.com
- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting (preferred)
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### 2. What to Include

Please include the following information:

- **Component**: Which part of CryptoTEE is affected
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce (if safe)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for a fix
- **Your Details**: How you'd like to be credited (optional)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity (1-30 days)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released (coordinated disclosure)

### 4. Severity Levels

#### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Cryptographic key exposure
- TEE bypass vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypass

#### High
- Local privilege escalation
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Data exfiltration
- Memory corruption

#### Medium
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Input validation issues

#### Low
- Minor information leaks
- Non-exploitable edge cases

## Security Best Practices

## Incident Response

### Process

1. **Detection**: Vulnerability reported or discovered
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Implement temporary mitigations
4. **Eradication**: Develop and test permanent fix
5. **Recovery**: Deploy fix and monitor
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review

### Communication

- **Users**: Security advisories for high/critical issues
- **Vendors**: Coordination with TEE vendors if needed
- **Community**: Responsible disclosure timeline
- **Authorities**: Comply with disclosure requirements

## Security Contacts

- **Primary**: security@example.com

## Bug Bounty

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we appreciate security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. We will:

- Acknowledge your contribution
- Provide credit in release notes (if desired)
- Work with you on responsible disclosure
- Consider compensation for critical findings

## Legal

Vulnerability research conducted in good faith and in compliance with this policy is authorized. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Act in good faith
- Follow responsible disclosure
