# Release Notes - CryptoTEE v0.1.0

We're excited to announce the first public release of CryptoTEE, a unified Rust interface for hardware security modules (TEEs/HSMs) across different platforms.

## Highlights

### üîê Hardware Security Made Easy
CryptoTEE provides a single, consistent API for interacting with various hardware security modules:
- Apple Secure Enclave on macOS/iOS
- Samsung Knox on Samsung devices
- Qualcomm QSEE on Android devices
- Software fallback for development and unsupported platforms

### üåç True Cross-Platform Support
Write once, run securely everywhere:
```rust
let crypto_tee = CryptoTEEBuilder::new().build().await?;
let key = crypto_tee.generate_key("my-key", options).await?;
```

### üìù RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures
Built-in support for the latest HTTP signature standard:
```rust
let builder = HttpSignatureBuilder::new(crypto_tee, "signing-key");
let signed_request = builder.sign_request(request).await?;
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Security First
- Hardware-backed keys that never leave the secure enclave
- Constant-time operations to prevent timing attacks
- Automatic memory zeroization
- Biometric authentication support

## Key Features

- **Unified API**: Same code works across all platforms
- **Async/Await**: Modern Rust async support throughout
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality with custom plugins
- **Performance**: Optimized with caching and memory pooling
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs with examples

## Getting Started
